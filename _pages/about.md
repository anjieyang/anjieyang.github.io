🧑🏻‍💻 I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa.

🔬 My research interests are centered around Machine Learning, with a particular focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI-generated content (AIGC).

📚 I am currently involved in projects that utilize diffusion models to enhance HCI applications.

🥰 Additionally, I am passionate about exploring various facets of Machine Learning, especially Multi-modal/Multi-sensory Large Language Models (MLLMs).

🎃 You can contact me by the methods listed on the left.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience

My background includes work in [SPICE Lab](https://spice-lab.org/) as an undergraduate research assistant, under the supervision of [Dr. Karan Ahuja](https://karan-ahuja.com/) at Northwestern University, focusing on the intersection of **XR**, **Generative AI**, and **3D Design**.

I'm also an undergraduate research assistant at University of Ottawa, under the supervision of [Dr. Yongyi Mao](https://www.eecs.uottawa.ca/~yymao/), focusing on **Machine Learning** and **Epidemiology**.

## 💻 Work Experience

I'm currently a research intern at [Eigent AI](https://www.eigent.ai/), working on the CRAB project, a cross-environment AI agent benchmark framework, which enables agents to operate multiple devices simultaneously.

I'm also a software development intern at Dreamflows, where I develop data pipelines for a text-to-video generation model and architect scalable systems to enhance AI-driven content creation.

## 🤖 Open Source Contribution

I've worked on [A-Tune](https://gitee.com/openeuler/A-Tune), an AI-driven OS tuning engine. I built a tool for performance analysis with a user-friendly CLI, making commit tracking more efficient and reducing manual tuning work.
