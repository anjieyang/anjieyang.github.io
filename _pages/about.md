🧑🏻‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at the University of Ottawa.

🔬 My research interests are in Machine Learning and Epidemiology.

📚 I’m currently working on integrating XR and Gen AI in 3D design, and applying Machine Learning to Epidemiology.

🥰 I'm also interested in various Machine Learning domains, including Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience

My background includes work in [Dr. Karan Ahuja](https://karan-ahuja.com/)'s group as an undergraduate research intern at Northwestern University, focusing on the intersection of **XR**, **Generative AI**, and **3D Design**.

I'm also an undergraduate research assistant at University of Ottawa, under the supervision of [Dr. Yongyi Mao](https://www.eecs.uottawa.ca/~yymao/), focusing on **Machine Learning** and **Epidemiology**.

## 🤖 Open Source Contribution

I've worked on [A-Tune](https://gitee.com/openeuler/A-Tune), an AI-driven OS tuning engine. I built a tool for performance analysis with a user-friendly CLI, making commit tracking more efficient and reducing manual tuning work.
