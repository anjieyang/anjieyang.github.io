🧑🏻‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate student at the University of Ottawa.

🔬 My research interests are in machine learning and epidemiology.

📚 I'm currently working on tuberculosis transmission prediction using traditional machine learning methods.

🥰 I'm also interested in various machine learning domains, including Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

# Selected Experience
## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience
My background includes work in [Dr. Karan Ahuja](https://karan-ahuja.com/)'s group as an undergraduate research intern at Northwestern University. Our project was at the exciting crossroads of XR, Generative AI, and 3D Design.

I also gained valuable experience as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Ottawa, under the supervision of [Dr. Yongyi Mao](https://www.eecs.uottawa.ca/~yymao/), focusing on predicting tuberculosis transmission in the Yukon region using traditional machine learning methods.

## 🤖 Open Source Contribution
I have experience contributing to [A-Tune](https://gitee.com/openeuler/A-Tune), an OS tuning engine powered by AI. I developed a Bisection Performance Analysis Tool with an eficient CLI, improving commit tracking efficiency and reducing manual performance tuning efforts.
