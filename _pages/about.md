🧑🏻‍💻 I am an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa.

🔬 My research interests are centered around Machine Learning, with a particular focus on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI-generated content (AIGC).

📚 I am currently working on enhancing human-AI interaction through communicative agents, exploring ways to make AI systems more intuitive and user-friendly.

🥰 Additionally, I am passionate about exploring various facets of Machine Learning, especially Embodied AI, Multi-modal Learning, and Computer Vision.

🎃 You can contact me by the methods listed on the left.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience

I am an undergraduate research assistant at [SPICE Lab](https://spice-lab.org/) at Northwestern University, under the supervision of [Dr. Karan Ahuja](https://karan-ahuja.com/), focusing on the intersection of **HCI**, **Generative AI**, and **3D Design**.

I am also an undergraduate research intern at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Pu Liang](https://pliang279.github.io/), focusing on integrating **HCI**, **Generative AI**, and **XR**.

Previously, I was an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Ottawa, under the supervision of [Dr. Yongyi Mao](https://www.eecs.uottawa.ca/~yymao/), focusing on **Machine Learning** and **Epidemiology**.

## 💻 Work Experience

I am currently a research intern at [Eigent AI](https://www.eigent.ai/), working on the [Camel](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel) project, an open-source library designed to facilitate the development of communicative agents.

I am also an AI Agent intern at [SoSoValue](https://sosovalue.com/), where I am developing autonomous agents that can post content, comment, and interact with users in online communities.

Previously, I was a software development intern at Dreamflows, where I developed data pipelines for a text-to-video generation model and architected scalable systems to enhance AI-driven content creation.

## 🤖 Open Source Contribution

I have worked on [A-Tune](https://gitee.com/openeuler/A-Tune), an AI-driven OS tuning engine. I built a tool for performance analysis with a user-friendly CLI, making commit tracking more efficient and reducing manual tuning work.
