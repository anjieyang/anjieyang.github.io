🧑🏻‍💻 I'm a final year undergraduate studnet at the University of Ottawa.

🔬 My research interest are in machine learning and epidemiology.

📚 I'm currently working on tuberculosis trnamission prediction using traditional machine learning methods.

🥰 I'm also interested in various machine learning domains, including Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

# Selected Experience
## 👨🏻‍🔬 Research Experience
I have research experience as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Ottawa, where I focus on predicting tuberculosis transmission in the Yukon region using traditional machine learning methods.

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [A-Tune](https://gitee.com/openeuler/A-Tune), an OS tuning engine powered by AI. I developed a Bisection Performance Analysis Tool, improving commit tracking efficiency and reducing manual performance tuning efforts.

Moreover, I also designed an efficient CLI for this tool, reducing setup time and enhancing productivity and debugging speed.
